# TM25_Dash-Datalogger
This repository will outline the background and design decisions associated with the display/datalogger module on the TM25 Formula SAE vehicle.  
## Background
TM25 has two main modules (the motor controller and the battery management system) that are capable of communicating various information about themselves, as well as having the ability of being controlled via a CANbus line. 
This design aims to read the CANbus and to decode the various information that the these systems can transmit. Furthermore, the information is to be shown on a display and logged onto an SD card. Future development can
include the wireless transmission of this information to a base station for real-time analysis from outside the car.  
## Design
### Vehicle Display  
The display that is used on the vehicle is a Nextion NX8048T050. This is a 5" display capable of interfacing with an Arduino/Teensy via its serial ports and has touchscreen functionality. Nextion an editor software: 
https://nextion.tech/editor_guide/ for the development of the UI for the display. The UI gets uploaded to the display and various fields/values get updated from the controller (Teensy in the case). The display 
can be programmed with the UI by inserting a microSD card with the UI file generated by the Nextion Editor. Note that the SD card must be formatted as FAT32. DiskGenius is a software that is capable of this
since by default Windows 10 does not support formatting of a device in FAT32.   
A version of the created UI can be seen below. Key information that is displayed to the driver includes the vehicle speed, battery state of charge, battery temperatures, motor and motor controller temperatures,
and power output. ![Display UI](/Images/Display GUI.png)
